1. geocoding.py is written to transform the addresses of all NYC WeWork locations into coordinates;
2. yelp_api_search_business.py is written to query for local businesses within a radius around all NYC WeWork locations, using lat/lon information generated by geocoding.py. It first uses yelp's search api, then uses its business api to query additional information about the top result from the search query.
